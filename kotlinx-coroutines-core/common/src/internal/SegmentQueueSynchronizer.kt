/**
 * [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] is an abstraction for implementing _fair_ synchronization and communication primitives.
 * It maintains a FIFO queue of waiting requests and provides two main functions:
 *   - [suspend] stores the specified waiter in the queue, and
 *   - [resume] tries to retrieve and resume the first waiter, passing the specified value to it.
 *
 * One may consider this abstraction an infinite array with two counters that reference the next cells
 * for enqueueing a continuation in [suspend] and for retrieving it in [resume]. In short, when [suspend] is invoked,
 * it increments the corresponding counter via fast `Fetch-And-Add` and stores the continuation in the cell.
 * Likewise, [resume] increments its counter, comes to the corresponding cell, and resumes the stored continuation
 * with the specified value. A typical implementation via [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] performs some synchronization
 * at first (e.g., [Semaphore] modifies the number of available permits in the beginning of [Semaphore.acquire])
 * and invokes [suspend] or [resume] after that. Note that in this case, it is possible in a concurrent environment
 * that [resume] comes to the cell before [suspend] and finds the cell in the empty state. This race is similar to
 * the one between concurrent `park` and `unpark` invocations for threads. We support two elimination [strategies][ResumeMode]
 * to solve the race, [asynchronous][ASYNC] and [synchronous][SYNC]:
 *   - In the [asynchronous][ASYNC] mode, [resume] performs an elimination by putting the value into the cell
 *     if it is still empty and finishes immediately; this way, the corresponding [suspend] comes to this cell
 *     and grabs the element without suspension.
 *   - In the [synchronous][SYNC] mode, [resume] waits in a bounded spin-loop cycle until the put element is taken
 *     by a concurrent [suspend], marking the cell as broken if the element is not taken during the spin-loop.
 *     In this case, both [resume] and [suspend] that come to this broken cell fail, and the outer operations
 *     on the data structure typically restart from the very beginning.
 *
 * Since [suspend] can store [CancellableContinuation]-s, it is possible for [resume] to fail if the continuation
 * is already cancelled. In this case, most of the algorithms retry the whole operation. In [Semaphore], for example,
 * when `release` fails on the next waiter resumption, it logically provides the permit to the waiter but takes it back
 * after if the waiter is canceled. In the latter case, the permit should be released again so that the operation restarts.
 *
 * However, the cancellation logic above requires to process all canceled cells. Thus, the operation that resumes waiters
 * (e.g., `release` in `Semaphore`) works in linear time in the number of consecutive canceled waiters. This way,
 * if N coroutines come to a semaphore, suspend, and cancel, the following `release` works in O(N) since it should
 * process all these N cells (and increment the counter of available permits in our implementation). While the complexity
 * is amortized by cancellations, it would be better to make such operations as `release` in `Semaphore` work predictably
 * fast, independently on the number of cancelled requests.
 *
 * The main idea to improve cancellation is skipping these `CANCELLED` cells so that [resume] always succeeds
 * if no elimination happens (remember that [resume] may fail in the [synchronous][SYNC] resumption mode if
 * it finds the cell empty). Additionally, a cancellation handler that modifies the data structure consequently
 * should be specified (in [Semaphore] it should increment the available permits counter back). Thus, we support
 * several cancellation policies in [SegmentQueueSynchronizer]. The [SIMPLE] cancellation mode is already described above
 * and used by default. In this mode, [resume] fails if it finds the cell in the `CANCELLED` state or if the waiter resumption
 * (see [CancellableContinuation.tryResume]) does not succeed. As we discussed, these failures are typically handled
 * by re-starting the whole operation from the beginning. With the other two smart cancellation modes,
 * [SMART_SYNC] and [SMART_ASYNC], [resume] skips `CANCELLED` cells (the cells where waiter resumption failed are also
 * considered as `CANCELLED`). This way, even if a million of canceled continuations are stored in [SegmentQueueSynchronizer],
 * one [resume] invocation is sufficient to pass the value to a waiter since it skips all these canceled waiters.
 * However, these modes provide less intuitive contracts and require users to write more complicated code;
 * the details are described further.
 *
 * The main issue with skipping `CANCELLED` cells in [resume] is that it can become illegal to put the value into
 * the next cell. Consider the following execution: [suspend] is called, then [resume] starts, but the suspended
 * waiter becomes canceled. This way, no waiter is waiting in [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] anymore. Thus, if [resume]
 * skips this canceled cell, puts the value into the next empty cell, and completes, the data structure's state becomes
 * incorrect. Instead, the value provided by this [resume] should be refused and returned to the outer data structure.
 * There is no way for [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] to decide whether the value should be refused automatically.
 * Instead, users should implement a cancellation handler by overriding the [onCancellation] function, which returns
 * `true` if the cancellation completes successfully and `false` if the [resume] that will come to this cell
 * should be refused. In the latter case, the [resume] that comes to this cell refuses its value by invoking
 * [tryReturnRefusedValue] to return it back to the outer data structure. However, it is possible for
 * [tryReturnRefusedValue] to fail, and [returnValue] is called in this case. Typically, this [returnValue] function
 * coincides with the one that resumes waiters (e.g., with [release][Semaphore.release] in [Semaphore]).
 * The difference between [SMART_SYNC] and [SMART_ASYNC] modes is that in the [SMART_SYNC] mode, a [resume] that comes
 * to a cell with a canceled waiter waits in a spin-loop until the cancellation handler is invoked and the cell
 * is moved to either `CANCELLED` or `REFUSE` state. In contrast, in the [SMART_ASYNC] mode, [resume] replaces
 * the canceled waiter with the value of this resumption and finishes immediately -- the cancellation handler
 * completes this [resume] eventually. This way, in [SMART_ASYNC] mode, the value passed to [resume] can be out
 * of the data structure for a while but is guaranteed to be processed eventually.
 *
 * It is worth noting that [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] supports prompt cancellation -- [returnValue] is called
 * when continuation is cancelled while dispatching.
 *
 * Here is a state machine for cells. Note that only one [suspend]
 * and at most one [resume] operation can deal with each cell.

 * The infinite array implementation is organized as a linked list of [segments][SQSSegment];
 * each segment contains a fixed number of cells. In order to determine the working cell
 * for each [suspend] and [resume]  invocation, the algorithm reads the current [tail] or [head],
 * increments [enqIdx] or [deqIdx], and finds the required segment starting from the initially read one.
 * It is also essential that this infinite array implementation does not store segments full of cells
 * in the CANCELLED state; thus, avoiding memory leaks on cancellation and guaranteeing constant complexity
 * for `resume`.

 * asynchronously puts its value into the cell, so that the cancellation handler decides whether
 * this value should be used for resuming the next waiter or be refused. When this
 * value is a continuation, it is hard to distinguish it with the one related to the cancelled
 * waiter. Thus, such values are wrapped with [WrappedContinuationValue] in this case. Note that the
 * wrapper is required only in [SegmentQueueSynchronizer.CancellationMode.SMART_ASYNC] mode
 * and is used in the asynchronous race resolution logic between cancellation and [resume]
 * invocation; this way, it is used relatively rare.
